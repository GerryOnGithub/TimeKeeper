Python program to track time

![Alt-text](images/tk-1.png)

Goal 1: track time with the least amount of distruption

Goal 2: track time with the least amount of distraction

Goal 3: track time with the least amount of effort

### Install dependencies
pip install pyyaml

### How To

To start tracking type a task name then go work on the task

To stop tracking select the blank entry in the drop down

To save to disk select a different item from the drop down, or close the program (hit X)

To restart tracking select the entry from the drop down

To change the number of minutes assigned to a task use 'Edit Tasks', edit, then Save

To fully delete an entry select it then hit the Delete key

### Caveat

Saving happens often but not on a timer - I'm not sure yet what happens if you leave tracking running and reboot. It might catch the 'closing' event or it might not. Hopefully it does.
